# LoginTest

Run **npm test** to run the script.

This Selenium script is an automated login test:
- Opens the login page
- Enters a sample email
- Clicks the "Next" button
- Captures any error message and logs it to console

If clicking the "Next" button was successful, it will:
- Enter a password
- Click the "Login" button
- Capture any error message and logs it to console
